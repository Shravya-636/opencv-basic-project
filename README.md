**Features:**
- Reads an image using OpenCV  
- Converts the image to grayscale  
- Displays the original and processed images
  
**  Libraries used:**
-OpenCV (cv2) : For image processing and camera access
-NumPy (numpy) : For numerical operations and array handling
-Mediapipe (mediapipe) : For face detection and landmark detection
