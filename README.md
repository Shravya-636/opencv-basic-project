This is a simple OpenCV project that performs basic image processing tasks using Python.  

**Features:**
- Reads an image using OpenCV  
- Converts the image to grayscale  
- Displays the original and processed images
  
**Libraries used:** 
- **OpenCV (`cv2`)** – For image processing and camera access  
- **NumPy (`numpy`)** – For numerical operations and array handling  
- **Mediapipe (`mediapipe`)** – For face detection and landmark detection
